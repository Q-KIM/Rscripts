\Abstract{
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive cancer of the brain with a median survival of 14 months. The cancer genome atlas was unable to resolve survival based on measurements from the tumour bulk. GBM has been shown to be maintained by a subpopulation of cells termed glioma-initiating cells (GICs). It may be these cells that are responsible for differences in survival.\\

The stem cell marker CD133 was used to isolate GICs by flow cytometry and the phenotypic properties of CD133+ and CD133- cells were compared by cellular and genome-wide methods. The transcriptome of a panel of human GIC samples was measured by RNA-seq to compare groups that differ by survival. The REST pathway was enriched in GICs obtained from short survivors and will be validated functionally.

  \subsection*{Some stats on prevalence and mortality}
  
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive, heterogeneous tumour of the central nervous system. These diverse morphological features have made diagnosis of GBM difficult (1). Molecular profiling of GBM tumours has revealed that similar to other tumours such as breast and ovarian cancer (2,3), GBM is not a single disease but consists of several distinct malignancies. Although GBM is a relatively rare type of cancer it has a 5 year survival of less than 5\% rendering it one of the most lethal types of tumours. Age is the most important risk factor for GBM, with incidence showing a 4th power relationship with age, indicative of a gradual accumulation of oncogenic mutations over time (7).

    \subsection*{Molecular Sub-classification of GBM}

Quantification of GBM gene expression by microarray combined with unsupervised machine learning techniques was able to differentiate between glioblastoma multiforme, low grade astrocytoma and oligodendrogliomas (13). Within the GBM set further clustering could separate 3 distinct groups of tumours (1,14).
These 3 groups were found to resemble specific stages in neuronal development. The proneural subtype resembled a differentiated neural cell type and displayed the best prognosis. Conversely the mesenchymal subtype resembled a primitive cell type and had the shortest survival (2,3,14).\\
Better update this with both Verhaak and Johnson 2014.\\
Genomic profiling of GBM has been performed by multiple laboratories with consistent segregation of proneural and mesenchymal subtypes. However differences occur in the number and molecular properties of subtypes that lie between the two extreme phenotypes (5,14,16-18).

 %   \paragraph {Predictive significance of a stemness signature}
    
% The clinical significance of CD133 and other stem cell markers are controversial. Immunohistochemistry does not show a statistically significant association of CD133 or CD15 positivity on survival (59). This is in contrast to studies at the mRNA level demonstrating that CD133 (PROM1) expression is a significant negative prognostic factor for both progression-free and overall survival in GBM (60).\\ 

\subsection*{Some info on cancer stem cell theory}  
    \paragraph {Why CD133 is not a good marker}

GICs were initially characterised by expression of the stem cell marker CD133 (PROM1) and were able to form tumours from 100 cells in immune deficient NOD-SCID mice (41). 
CD133 or prominin-1 was originally described as being an epitope enriched in a hybridoma screen against CD34 isolated haemopoetic progenitors (42). 
The marker was later shown to be expressed by neural progenitor cells from human fetal brains (43). There are a number of limitations of the CD133 marker for glioma initiating cells. The protein itself is a 115-kDa membrane-associated glycoprotein with no known molecular function, conserved in humans, mice, worms and flies (44). 
The two major commercial antibodies target different glycoslyated regions of the protein, the precise locations of which are currently unknown. (45). CD133 undergoes mRNA splicing, generating at least 28 isoforms (46), contributing to the variation in detection by antibodies.\\
However CD133- cells are able to form tumours when 10 spheroids were orthotopically implanted into rat brains. The resulting tumours contained a small fraction of CD133+ cells (48).
Without a molecular marker to separate CD133- stem cells from non-stem cells it is difficult to examine the properties of this cell type. A variety of other stem cell markers have been trialed such as the adhesion molecules CD44, Integrin-alpha6, CD15 and the multiple-drug resistance protein ABCG2 but have not found wide spread use (45).\\
\textbf{Expand this intro section to discuss the other markers}

\subsection*{Some info FACS and the use of markers to isolate subpopulations}  

Flow cytometry is a classical technique in cell biology to isolate and study subpopulations. It relies on a robust extracellular marker and previous characteristisation of the propperties of the cells isolated by the markers.\\
\textbf{Expand this section on literature demonstrating the use of FACS and stem cell markers.}

\subsection*{Literature on studies which compare markers}  
    \paragraph {Studies that I am trying to copy}
    
Some of the important references are \textbf {Mesenchymal glioma stem cells are maintained by activated glycolytic metabolism involving aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A3}. This article states that proneural GSCs express mainly CD133 whereas mesenchymal GSCs express mainly CD44. There is also overlap with ALDH1 and CD44.
    
\subsection*{Some info on weighted coexpression analysis}  
    \paragraph {Some stuff}
Some of the important references are \textbf {WGCNA: an R package for weighted correlation network analysis}.
Instead of relating thousands of genes to a microarray sample trait, it focuses on the relationship between a few (typically less than 10) modules and the sample trait. 
Modules are constructed from the expression data by using hierarchical clustering.\\
By raising the absolute value of the correlation to a power \math{\beta > 1} % Check this line
 $ (soft thresholding), the weighted gene co-expression network construction emphasizes high correlations at the expense of low correlations.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\hspace*{-\tocsep}Methods} % Adds this section to the table of contents with negative horizontal space equal to the indent for the numbered sections
  \subsection*{Raw data munging}  
    \paragraph {The boring stuff}
The munging information is located in the supplemental data.
The  weighted gene co-expression network analysis package was used within the R version 3.0.1 environment. The gene expression data was level 3 data that was measured by the TCGA was imported using the broad firehose wget tool. The Agilent array data was selected for various reasons (Supplemenatary).

  \subsection*{WGCNA parameters}  
    \paragraph {How and why various thresholds were set}
Firstly the gene expression matrix was measured for correlation by the WGCNA function \textbf{corAndPvalue}. The following parameters were selected as the cuttoff for determining the significantly coexpressed genes with CD133 \textbf{...}.\\
The vector of these gene names was then used to build the network of coexpressed genes using the manual module construction method.
    
  \subsection*{Gene set enrichment of coexpressed genes}  
    \paragraph {How the enrichments were done}
As the R package for GSEA is not fully mature the analysis was carried out with the java based GUI. Preranked mode

  \subsection*{Survival analysis}  
    \paragraph {The method used to interogate the gene signatures with clinical parameteres.}
Single sample (ss) GSEA is probably the most common choice. I could also use the Coleman et al gene signature score approach. Either way I present this using Kaplan Myier curves.

  \subsection*{Discovering the suite of CD133 coexpressed genes}
    \paragraph {What I discovered}
The PROM1 gene was processed with WGCNA using the Agilent microarray data from the TCGA glioblastoma (figure 2 top). This sections describes the pattern of coexpressed genes and outlines the overall approach.

# Make the adjacency matrix square
squareAdjacency = (adjacencyProm1[colnames(adjacencyProm1),])

# Calculate the similarity matrix

# Set diagonal to NA for a nicer plot
diag(plotTOM) = NA

# Call the hierarchical clustering function. This is the faster implementation of WGCNA version
geneTree = flashClust(as.dist(dissTOM), method = "average")

#Branches of the dendrogram group together densely interconnected, highly co-expressed genes. Module identifcation amounts to the identification of individual branches
#There are several methods for branch cutting; our standard method is the Dynamic Tree Cut from the package dynamicTreeCut

# Module identification using dynamic tree cut. This is the most basic method and returns 3 modules when the cutHeight is 0.999 (default 0.99)
dynamicMods = cutreeDynamic(dendro = geneTree, cutHeight=0.999, method='tree')

# Convert numeric lables into colors
dynamicColors = labels2colors(dynamicMods)

# Plot the heatmap
TOMplot(plotTOM, geneTree, dynamicColors, main = "Network heatmap plot of CD133 coexpressed genes")

@
The set of \textbf {134} genes that were significantly coexpressed were subsequently analysed by weighted coexpression analysis to identify the patterns of coexpression. Supplying only a subset of expressed genes also greatly decreased the run time of the network adjacency algorithm.
The adjacency matrix was transformed into a similarity matrix and a heatmap was generated (figure 3).

  \subsection*{A network of CD133 coexpressed genes}  
    \paragraph {Network analysis}
Use the STRING database to pull some information on the known interactions bwtween the suite of CD133 coexpressed genes. The import the binary interaction matrix into cytoscape and decorate it with information on the correlation values and the p-values. Use the degree sorted layout to give an idea of the hub genes. Be sure to highlight where CD133 is.\\
This manual network is probably going to be more relevant than the dendogram I have currently in there.

  \subsection*{Clinical relevance of CD133 coexpressed genes}  
    \paragraph {The most important part I guess}
    
Paritition the TCGA data in some fashion using the CD133 signature and look for a survival difference between the high and low.Posssibly a low, medium and high.\\
Look for overlap with the 4 established subtypes. Look for any enriched mutations (eg IDH1) in the groups that may explain the CD133 phenotype \textbf{stem-like or other}. Also do MGMT and the general epigentic landscape if interesting.
